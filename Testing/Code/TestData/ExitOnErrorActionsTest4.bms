# This combo should report errors
#
# This script should exit if there is an error, and there
# will be errors.  This test also tests flipping the value
# of ExitOnError back and forth.
#
# Test this by creating 2 errors with ExitOnError(0),
# then change ExitOnError(1), add 2 more errors. But we
# should have exited after 3 errors.
#
# test 4 combinations
# combos, first value is ExitOnError val, second val is will return error
# 0,0 ExitOnErrorActionsTest1.bms
# 1,0 ExitOnErrorActionsTest2.bms
# 0,1 ExitOnErrorActionsTest3.bms
# 1,1 ExitOnErrorActionsTest4.bms
ExitOnError( 1 )
# test flipping the value
ExitOnError( 0 )
