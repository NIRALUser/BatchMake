# This combo should report errors
# 
# This script should not exit if there is an error, but there
# will be errors. Test this by running a command without
# error, then add 2 errors, then exit.  At the end it should
# have exited with 2 errors, but if the ExitOnError(0) would
# have cause an exit after the first error, then there will
# only be 1 error after exiting.  This tests ensures that
# ExitOnError(0) will not exit when there is an error.
#
# test 4 combinations
# combos, first value is ExitOnError val, second val is will return error
# 0,0 ExitOnErrorActionsTest1.bms
# 1,0 ExitOnErrorActionsTest2.bms
# 0,1 ExitOnErrorActionsTest3.bms
# 1,1 ExitOnErrorActionsTest4.bms
ExitOnError( 0 )
Echo('some command without error')
AddError('error 1 should not exit')
AddError('error 2 should not exit')
Exit()
